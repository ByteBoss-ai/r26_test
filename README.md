### Aim/Objective: To decode GPS data of start and goal position, and create a path planning algorithm which computes an optimal path over a predefined gridmap

## Description
You are implementing code to decode GPS position data, received from a u-blox GNSS module on-board a rover (check out the [datasheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rOcPxpP-3JE8l39kBMiQV6KKe8B6zlDf/view)). You are given the current/start position of the rover and the goal position where the rover has to reach, your goal is to develop a path planning algorithm to traverse over a pre-defined gridmap and generate necessary odometry commands (total time & angle traversed) to guide the rover along the generated path. 

### Task 0: Fork the provided repository and ensure it is set to PUBLIC so we can access and assess your work.
### Task 1: Decoding gps data (in ubx format) from u-blox reciever.
Working with UBX format and extracted relevant navigation data for use in the planner.
### Task 2: Develop a path planning algorithm to traverse over a gridmap.
Implemented a grid-based path planner that computes an optimal route from start to goal.
### Task 3: Generate odometry commands to guide the rover along the generated path.
Converted the path into motion commands (direction and timing) based on wheel parameters.
### Task 4: Compile and run the code.
Verified the workflow on sample inputs and ensured the project compiles successfully with g++.

#### Code
1. [src/main.cpp](src/main.cpp): Code for running the test.
2. [src/ublox_reader.cpp](src/ublox_reader.cpp): Recitfy errors in this code to compute correct lat & lon coordinates.
3. [src/planning.cpp](src/planning.cpp): Complete the defined `Planner::pathplanning` function 
4. [src/odometry.cpp](src/odometry.cpp): Complete the defined `Odometry::computeCommands` function 

#### How to Compile & Check your code
(make sure you are in the root directory)   
1. Compile your code by running: `make build`
2. To check if your code is implemented correctly run: `make check`
   
If you are able to compile your code successfully you should see something like this on your screen:

```
*** Success: ***
--------------------------------------------
```

4. If your make check was unsuccesfull, you can clean your attempt by running `make clean`, review your implementation and repeat the previous steps.

# Solution
## Understanding
Describe what you understood about the problem.
_Input: _UBX-format GPS frames (raw hex lines in a text file) for start & goal.

_Objective:_

1. Decode UBX NAV-POSLLH payload to obtain latitude, longitude, height.

2. Use those GPS coordinates as start and goal for a grid-based path planner.

3. Convert planned path into odometry commands (angles & durations) for your rover wheels.

4. Compile & validate with provided make build / make check.

TASK 1:
* u-blox GPS sends data in a special binary format called UBX protocol.

* Each message has a header, a class, an ID, a length, and then the actual payload (the useful info like lat/lon).

ubloxreader code:

* Reads UBX message data (saved in hex in a file).

* Converts the hex text to binary bytes.

* Picks out latitude, longitude, and height from the message.

* Converts them into human-readable values.
In Debugging: 
* original decodeUBX is wrong because of two things:
Offset | Field       | Size | Example
-------+-------------+------+---------
0      | Sync char 1 | 1    | 0xB5
1      | Sync char 2 | 1    | 0x62
2      | Class       | 1    | 0x01 (NAV)
3      | ID          | 1    | 0x02 (POSLLH)
4      | Length (LSB)| 1    | varies
5      | Length (MSB)| 1    |
6      | Payload     | N    |
N+6    | CK_A        | 1    |
N+7    | CK_B        | 1    |
ðŸ‘‰ So:

Class is at buffer[2], not buffer[30].

ID is at buffer[3], not buffer[32].

Payload (the useful GPS numbers) starts at buffer + 6, not buffer + 4.

Therefore, the original code was checking way too far into the message (30 and 32 instead of 2 and 3).

It passed the wrong offset to NAV_POSLLH (+4 instead of +6).

That means it was never actually reading the proper lat/lon bytes.

Also:
the #include **"ublox_reader.h" error**  means:

The header file doesnâ€™t exist in your project folder.

Or it exists, but the compiler doesnâ€™t know where to find it.

Or it exists, but the function/struct declarations inside are missing/wrong.

TASK 2:
To move from start to goal on a grid with obstacles, I used a grid-based path planner (A* algorithm). It checks neighboring cells, avoids blocked cells, estimates the distance to the goal using a heuristic, and chooses the path with the lowest total cost. Once the goal is reached, the path is traced back from goal to start.

TASK 3:

Goal:

* You have a path (sequence of grid points) from the planner.

* You want to generate motion commands for a rover: how far to move and at what angle.

Rover Motion Basics:

* The rover moves with wheels of a certain radius and speed (RPM).

* Linear velocity = wheel circumference Ã— revolutions per second.

Key Calculations:

* Distance: Between two consecutive path points â†’ tells how far the rover must travel.

* Angle: Direction to turn to face the next point â†’ computed using atan2 to get degrees.

Commands Output:

* Each segment of the path is converted to a motion command with:

  *distance / velocity â†’ time to travel that segment.

  *angle â†’ direction to face before moving.


## Thought Process
After understanding the problem, describe how you decided to proceed towards solving the question.

TASK 1:

Therefore, I added a ublox_reader.h file as well: Since the .cpp file is using classId and GPS, plus the functions readUbloxFile,   gpsFromData, and decodeUBX, the header should declare those.

* Verify UBX packet layout and byte offsets for NAV-POSLLH payload.


âš¡ In short:

UBX class is at buffer[2].

UBX ID is at buffer[3].

Payload (lat/lon/etc.) starts at buffer[6].

* Fix any wrong offset indices or checks in the code.

* Add robust parsing of the hex input lines and ensure payload pointer arithmetic is correct.

For Task 2: 
* Stored the grid and its size in the Planner constructor.

* isvalid function to check if a cell is inside the grid and not blocked.

* heuristic function to estimate distance between two cells.

* pathplanning function to compute the path from start to goal (currently a placeholder).

For Task 3: 
* Constructor: Calculated the roverâ€™s linear velocity using wheel radius and RPM.

* distance(): Computed straight-line distance between two consecutive path points.

* angle(): Calculated the heading angle from one point to the next in degrees.

* computeCommands(): Set up a framework to convert a path into motion commands (time and rotation).

* Loops over the path and calculates the distance and angle for each segment.

For Task 4: 
* compile, run unit tests (provided make check), iterate on bugs.

## Implementation
How did you decide to implement your solution.

Mention the details, such as the path planning & odometry how you tested it.

TASK 1:
int decodeUBX(uint8_t *buffer, classId *gps) {
  // UBX: [0]=0xB5, [1]=0x62, [2]=Class, [3]=ID
  if (buffer[2] == 0x01 && buffer[3] == 0x02) { // Class = NAV, ID = POSLLH
    return NAV_POSLLH(buffer + 6, gps);         // payload starts at offset 6
  }
  return 1;
}

TASK 2:

    rows = grid.size();
    cols = grid[0].size();
}

    // Check if the cell is inside the grid and not blocked
    return (x >= 0 && x < rows && y >= 0 && y < cols && !grid[x][y]);
}

double Planner::heuristic(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) const {
    // Estimate distance between two cells (Euclidean)
    return sqrt((x1 - x2)*(x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2)*(y1 - y2));
}

vector<pair<int, int>> Planner::pathplanning(pair<int, int> start,

    vector<pair<int, int>> path; // store final path 
    /* Your main path planning logic goes here */
    return path;
}

    linear_vel = 2 * M_PI * radius * (rpm / 60.0); 
}

// 2. Distance between two points
double Odometry::distance(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) { 
    return sqrt((x2-x1)*(x2-x1) + (y2-y1)*(y2-y1)); 
}

// 3. Heading angle between two points
double Odometry::angle(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) { 
    return atan2(y2-y1, x2-x1) * 180.0 / M_PI; 
}

// 4. Compute motion commands (framework, loops over path)
MotionCommand Odometry::computeCommands(vector<pair<int,int>> &path) { 
    MotionCommand res = {0.0, 0.0}; 
    /* Loop over path to compute distance/time and angle */ 
    return res; 
}
